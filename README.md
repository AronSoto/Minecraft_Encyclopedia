I decided not to use frameworks in this project in order to demonstrate my ability over HTML, CSS and native JavaScript. By avoiding frameworks, I have had full control over every aspect of development, which has allowed me to custom optimize the code and minimize the use of unnecessary code or external dependencies. This has also forced me to tackle and solve problems directly, honing my fundamental skills and gaining a deeper understanding of how each element works in the browser. No responsive yet!!

```
Visual transitions:

✨ Panels are designed to have
a smooth transition when interacting
with them, featuring subtle hover
effects. The overall structure
maintains a clean and minimalist
design 🖥️, with a dark background 🌑
that highlights the vibrant colors
of the Minecraft animals 🦊🐑🐝.

🌿 Each animal's panels are carefully
designed so that their visual
environments don't collapse during
transitions. Each maintains its
visual integrity when hovering or
clicking, avoiding presentation
errors or abrupt changes 🚫.
